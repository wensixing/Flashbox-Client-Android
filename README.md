#Flashbox-Client-Android
## Discription
I made a simple application which can let smart phone user play flash game using virtual key.  
including  client side and server side (https://github.com/wensixing/Flashbox-Server).  
Most of games comes from http://www.4399.com/, which can only be played in PC browser.
